# SipSipHooray
Sip Sip Hooray is a web app that displays cocktails and mocktails. Once you open the app, you will see a drop down that allows you to filter through the drinks based on drink type. You can click 'Need the Deets!' and that will display a card with the drink type, glass needed, ingredients and instructions. You can then click the 'Love It' button to fill in the heart.

You can then select cocktails or mocktails in the top nav to display those 2 types of drinks. The 'Need the Deets!' button functions in the same way as before.

Finally, you can click 'Shake it up' in the top nav. That will randomly generate a drink. If you click the 'Shake it Up!' button it will randomly generate another drink.
